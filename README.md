# Money War - Spider Web Task 3

You are organizing an exhibition for setting up an auction for ancient relics.
Unfortunately, due to the present Covid Pandemic, you are unable to conduct a
physical event for your exhibition. So, you decided to move the setup to a
Virtual Environment. You have to create a website to organize your Auction
online. The website should allow different users to participate and put-up items
in your exhibition.

## Basic mode: (50 Points)
1. Users should be able to sign in and register securely. No frameworks like
passport.js should be used to implement authorization. Passwords must
be hashed (for hashing npm packages can be used).
2. Users should be allowed to add, update, and delete their products. All the
products should have an image and the necessary details regarding the
product. The product should also contain tags to describe it more clearly.
3. For each product, the time limit must be specified by the owner after
which Bidding for that product will not be allowed.
4. Owners should be able to see the details for all the bidders who bid for
that product.
5. The website should have a public page where products will be showcased
with the highest bidder for that particular product.
6. Create a profile page for each individual user. Products should be
displayed according to the highest bid at that time.
